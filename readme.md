# MilestonePM Bot

Thanks for using the MilestonePM bot! ðŸ˜Š

This Discord bot helps manage projects, milestones, and tasks within your Discord server. It provides a comprehensive project management system with role-based permissions and milestone tracking.

## Concepts and Usuage

MilestonePM works by mapping project to discord server categories and its channels. This means that any channel within an active project's category can run commands to interact with that project

## Command Documentation Format

**Arguments**: `[argname]` - Command arguments where the brackets indicate to put a value and `argname` is the name of the argument you are setting. Format: `argname:value`

**Example**: `/help [cmd]` - The help command expects an argument "cmd" with the command name  
Valid usage: `/help cmd:project` - Gives more info about project commands

## Autocomplete

- Please use autocomplete! This will give you the available options for a command and speed up writing commands
- We'll continue working to add more autocomplete in the future

*Note*: Spaces are okay with command arguments thanks to Discord's API ðŸ˜Š
